    <title>A Narrative Introduction to Probability :: Narrative Introduction to Probabilistic Computing</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/chapters/intro/index.html</link>
    <description>Introduction acknowledgements&#xA;Goals Introduce probability theory and Bayesian inference from a set-based perspective. Uses real-world examples and examples to introduce key concepts, such as conditional and marginal probability, independence, and Bayesâ€™ rule. Tailored examples to highlight common misconceptions (e.g., base-rate neglect with taxicab problem) and how thinking through it clearly using tools from tutorial. Provide the knowledge and confidence to start learning probabilistic computing and transition to that in the next tutorial Present everything in a friendly narrative for approachability Chibany is hungry</description>
